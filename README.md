# CyberSentinel AI

An entry-level submission to the Bright Data Real-Time AI Agents Challenge by a self-taught IT learner using AI to bridge gaps in cybersecurity learning.

## 🚀 Project Summary

CyberSentinel AI is a beginner-friendly project that:
- Crawls public cybersecurity-related discussions (e.g. Reddit, forums)
- Uses an open-source LLM to summarize posts and extract threat indicators
- Classifies risk levels and logs them to a searchable database (FAISS)
- Displays findings using a simple Streamlit dashboard

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As someone new to IT and cybersecurity, I wanted to explore how AI tools could help me understand and detect phishing threats, scams, and other real-time online dangers. This project was built with curiosity, not credentials — and serves as a living example of what AI-assisted learning looks like from the ground up.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- FAISS (vector search)
- Ollama + Mistral (or other local LLMs)
- Reddit API (or Bright Data API)
- FastAPI (optional)

## 📝 Features

- Real-time data ingestion (simulated or scraped)
- LLM-based summarization and classification
- Threat search via FAISS
- Beginner-friendly UI via Streamlit

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- How to use LangChain and vector databases
- How to work with local LLMs using Ollama
- How to document learning transparently for the community
